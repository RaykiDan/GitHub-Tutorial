# How To Fork & Clone a GitHub Repository
Forking and cloning is essential to work with others on a project. Both have the same function, to sort of duplicate a GitHub repository. 
The difference is forking will duplicate the repository in your own GitHub account, while cloning will duplicate the repository in to your local computer.
