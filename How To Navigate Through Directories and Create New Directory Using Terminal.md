### 1. Open Terminal
Most of OS comes with it's own terminal, including Ubuntu. Click the code tab-like icon in the menu bar, it would then open the terminal

### 2. Navigate Through Directories
There's several things we can do to help us navigate through directories.

`Pwd` used to print the path to the directory you currently working. It helps you to confirm you are in the right directory you want to work with. 
Everytime you open terminal, it will start with your home directory.

`ls` used to lists information about directories and any type of files in the working directory.

Now you know every directories and files inside the working directory, use `cd <directory name>` to change your working directory to the selected directory. 
For example, you want to change to Desktop directory. Type `cd Desktop/` and the working directory will change to the Desktop directory.

Repeat the `ls` and `cd` command and use `pwd` to make sure you are in the right track until you are in the correct directory. 
For example, I want to navigate to my Apps directory in Desktop.

### 3. Create New Directory
Let's say, you still don't have the directory you want to work with. We can use `mkdir <directory name>` command to make new directory in the working directory we are currently.
Then, use `cd <directory name>` again to navigate to the new directory.
